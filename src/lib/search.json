Big thanks for Heisenbergirl for pointing out the NJS felt off. Playing around with it I've now raised it to 13 (from 12) and learnt a valuable skill when it comes to mapping. Basically the NJS spaces out the notes a bit more so makes it easier to read.\r\nI also adjusted a couple of the opening notes on Hard because I didn't really like the way that they flowed.\r\nFinally just want to apologise to everyone who's worked hard on a score or left a review. It sucks to have to reset it like this but it did need the update.\r\n\r\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZMvCvyarYA","uploader":{"id":4785,"name":"stumi","uniqueSet":false,"hash":"5cff0b7398cc5a672c84f720","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5cff0b7398cc5a672c84f720?d=retro","type":"SIMPLE"},"metadata":{"bpm":152.0,"duration":188,"songName":"My songs know what you did in the dark","songSubName":"Fall Out Boy","songAuthorName":"Stumi","levelAuthorName":"stumi"},"stats":{"plays":0,"downloads":15797,"upvotes":5260,"downvotes":119,"score":0.9419},"uploaded":"2019-01-27T13:00:05Z","automapper":false,"ranked":false,"qualified":false,"versions":[{"hash":"5b53a3bede4fd8ee0950d0c5ba2dbbff73b6d127","key":"319f","state":"Published","createdAt":"2019-01-27T13:00:05Z","sageScore":6,"diffs":[{"njs":10.0,"offset":0.0,"notes":243,"bombs":4,"obstacles":93,"nps":1.362,"length":452.0,"characteristic":"Standard","difficulty":"Easy","events":1723,"chroma":false,"me":false,"ne":false,"cinema":false,"seconds":178.421,"paritySummary":{"errors":23,"warns":13,"resets":0}},{"njs":10.0,"offset":0.0,"notes":328,"bombs":4,"obstacles":95,"nps":1.838,"length":452.0,"characteristic":"Standard","difficulty":"Normal","events":1723,"chroma":false,"me":false,"ne":false,"cinema":false,"seconds":178.421,"paritySummary":{"errors":28,"warns":28,"resets":2}},{"njs":11.0,"offset":0.0,"notes":514,"bombs":4,"obstacles":75,"nps":2.881,"length":452.0,"characteristic":"Standard","difficulty":"Hard","events":1725,"chroma":false,"me":false,"ne":false,"cinema":false,"seconds":178.421,"paritySummary":{"errors":25,"warns":18,"resets":1}},{"njs":13.0,"offset":0.0,"notes":693,"bombs":8,"obstacles":58,"nps":3.884,"length":452.0,"characteristic":"Standard","difficulty":"Expert","events":1726,"chroma":false,"me":false,"ne":false,"cinema":false,"seconds":178.421,"paritySummary":{"errors":27,"warns":21,"resets":4}}],"downloadURL":"https://cdn.beatsaver.com/5b53a3bede4fd8ee0950d0c5ba2dbbff73b6d127.zip","coverURL":"https://cdn.beatsaver.com/5b53a3bede4fd8ee0950d0c5ba2dbbff73b6d127.jpg","previewURL":"https://cdn.beatsaver.com/5b53a3bede4fd8ee0950d0c5ba2dbbff73b6d127.mp3"}],"createdAt":"2019-01-27T13:00:05Z","updatedAt":"2019-01-27T13:00:05Z","lastPublishedAt":"2019-01-27T13:00:05Z"},{"id":"ac0a","name":"Hornet (Hollow Knight OST)","description":"This song really loses something without Hornet's war cries of \"SHAA\" and \"HEGAALE\" every three seconds.

It's now possible thanks to Noodle Extensions, and I'm proud to present to you the first Undertale modchart: Spider Dance, where you will confront Muffet.\r\n\r\nTips for a better experience:\r\n- Don't use static lights; there shouldn't be any lights\r\n- Hide the HUD in player settings\r\n- Enable \"bloom post-processing\"\r\n- Enable \"screen distortion effects\"\r\n\r\nInstallation instructions:\r\n- You will need Noodle Extensions and Chroma and their dependencies. All are now available on ModAssistant.\r\n- If you read this in a future where the update broke the mods and they haven't been approved on ModAssistant yet, install the basic mods from ModAssistant and get the latest releases of Noodle Extensions, Heck, and Chroma from Aeroluna's GitHub: https://github.com/Aeroluna\r\n\r\nVideo: https://youtu.be/fy8KmUor6fI\r\n\r\nI started this a while ago before Ghost Choir and then abandoned the project.

This was not the one they asked for, but his request inspired me to do one of the same genre anyway. I'm happy with the way that expert turned out, but the other difficulties are perhaps a bit rushed on this one. I've left easy out again as the play rates are so low.

Also thanks to Crankor, TurtleSquared, and all my other play testers for multiple play tests and a lot of good feedback. Also this map would not have been possible without squeaksies' MediocreMapper!\nTIPS:\n\n(Expert/Expert+) In the final flow pattern in the last slow section of the song, the corner crouch is meant to make you do a sort of side lunge with that lunging side's saber swinging out wide behind you for balance. I have found that to be the smoothest flow, though it's not technically necessary.\n\n(Expert+ only) The \"climax\" point of each pattern in the ending flow is made to be an optional behind-the-back cross slash. You'll know it by the dotted cubes in that section. The backslash hand hits the dotted cubes. This move is fun but may take some practice to get down. (Hint: keep your eye on the top diagonal cube.)\n\nSwing those arms for the big hits.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6NJh98lDJVo","uploader":{"id":27595,"name":"baxter395","uniqueSet":true,"hash":"5cff0b7598cc5a672c852f7b","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5cff0b7598cc5a672c852f7b?d=retro","type":"SIMPLE"},"metadata":{"bpm":127.0,"duration":204,"songName":"Chop Suey","songSubName":"System of a Down","songAuthorName":"baxter395","levelAuthorName":"baxter395"},"stats":{"plays":0,"downloads":12175,"upvotes":8010,"downvotes":385,"score":0.9242},"uploaded":"2018-10-25T00:30:35Z","automapper":false,"ranked":false,"qualified":false,"versions":[{"hash":"1b6f9e844d81ff0f6ee6feed62331a3d229be2e8","key":"1c00","state":"Published","createdAt":"2018-10-25T00:30:35Z","sageScore":-2,"diffs":[{"njs":10.0,"offset":0.0,"notes":497,"bombs":0,"obstacles":11,"nps":2.601,"length":404.463,"characteristic":"Standard","difficulty":"Normal","events":1156,"chroma":false,"me":false,"ne":false,"cinema":false,"seconds":191.085,"paritySummary":{"errors":75,"warns":56,"resets":0}},{"njs":11.0,"offset":0.0,"notes":687,"bombs":0,"obstacles":34,"nps":3.595,"length":404.463,"characteristic":"Standard","difficulty":"Hard","events":1156,"chroma":false,"me":false,"ne":false,"cinema":false,"seconds":191.085,"paritySummary":{"errors":57,"warns":89,"resets":0}},{"njs":12.0,"offset":0.0,"notes":804,"bombs":0,"obstacles":62,"nps":4.208,"length":404.463,"characteristic":"Standard","difficulty":"Expert","events":1156,"chroma":false,"me":false,"ne":false,"cinema":false,"seconds":191.085,"paritySummary":{"errors":64,"warns":100,"resets":0}},{"njs":13.0,"offset":0.0,"notes":842,"bombs":0,"obstacles":54,"nps":4.406,"length":404.463,"characteristic":"Standard","difficulty":"ExpertPlus","events":1156,"chroma":false,"me":false,"ne":false,"cinema":false,"seconds":191.085,"paritySummary":{"errors":58,"warns":110,"resets":0}}],"downloadURL":"https://cdn.beatsaver.com/1b6f9e844d81ff0f6ee6feed62331a3d229be2e8.zip","coverURL":"https://cdn.beatsaver.com/1b6f9e844d81ff0f6ee6feed62331a3d229be2e8.jpg","previewURL":"https://cdn.beatsaver.com/1b6f9e844d81ff0f6ee6feed62331a3d229be2e8.mp3"}],"createdAt":"2018-10-25T00:30:35Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-25T00:30:35Z","lastPublishedAt":"2018-10-25T00:30:35Z"},{"id":"b724","name":"Falling -

Please take the time to configure your game properly if you want to see it how it was intended. I know, it's super annoying, but there's nothing I can do about it. There's no better system. Basically if the intro to the map is white for like more than a second, you see the BTS logo, or if your walls look +'s than it's broken.\n\n!! WARNINGS !!\n- Use the newest versions of Chroma and NE (Available on ModAssistant), they'll allow for you to actually use the new environment enhancements. New NE will also SIGNIFICANTLY increase performance. I have not tested if this is playable on previous versions of NE.\n- Use all effects on lights. Remember this is expert not E+ so you need to adjust the \"Environment Effects\" setting. This map is by no means intense, but no flickering wasn't built for chroma and will break the lighting.\n- Turn off shockwave, as there's a bug where it cuts off distortion effects on walls that are under you\n- Turn on bloom, Beat Saber tries to make baked lighting on walls and they break on Noodle walls. You can ignore this if you have the mod that fixes this, although I don't know how the look will change.\n- Please disable NJSFixer, as this completely breaks the walls :(\n\nI've spent equal, if not, MORE time on this than Homesick. This map utilizes the new Chroma environment enhancements. I really went all out with it. I think this map is really unique and there are few, if not NO other maps so far that offer the experience this map gives right now. \n\nThis song means a lot to me. I've had this song added since summer 2019, it came up in my recommended and I fell in love with it. It's such an incredible vibe and it makes me feel super comfy.

Extreme Measures?\"\nNarrator : reading through the pact, Zagreus understood it meant that each underworld boss will be significantly stronger with new weapons at thier disposal.........including the last one that so happens to be his very own father !\nZagreus : \"How hard can it be? let's go ! \"\n\nNarrator: And thus Zagreus began yet another escape attempt, with the thought of the pact in his mind......\n\n.......Time goes by..............\n\nAfter fighting the Fury sisters, vanquishing the Hydra, beating Theseus and Asterius and braving through the Satyr tunnels, he finally arrives to his final showdown.....\nOpening the gates to the surface, Zagreus Green and Red eyes spot a figure in Golden-Red armor, this figure was also the final obstacle to his mothers cabin....\n\nThus the two begin a dialog :\nZagrues : \"Think you can beat me this time, Father?\"\nHades : \"I was reviewing the terms of the Pact of Punishment to which you are bound.\nEven when my servants resort to extreme measures, they were still unable to surpass you then.\nSo now.....it is my turn !\"\nZagrues : \"Caught you unprepared, did I? After Theseus and his Macedonian, I half-expected to see you thundering around by some golden chariot of your own, drawn by sable steeds, that sort of thing\nBut......it's just you.....\"\nHades : \"It is just me indeed.\nHowever...that should be more than necassary here.\nNo holding back this time Zagrues, are you ready?\"\nZagrues : \"Let's go !!\" \n\nThus the two begin yet another brawl of darkness and blood.\nAfter exchanging countless blows, Zagrues manages to down his father twice but not before suffering a few himself, as Hades falls for the second time, Zagrues expects him to vanish back to the underwrold as would normally happen, however.......\n\nHades : \" Urgh....no.......I am not......finished......with you........yet!!!\"\nNarrator : and thus to Zagrues complete surprise, his father once again regains his balance and is fired with a fighting spirit he has never yet seen.\nHades : \"I can still fight !!\"\nZagrues : \"Are you serious?!\"\n\nHades : \"DARKNESS !\"\nNarrator : Hades vanishes once more and engulfes the entire region in darkness, which hinders Zagrues abillity to see and regains his whereabouts..........\nJust then, Zagrues remembered that he carried his father's keepsake sigil, one which allowed him to use his father's powers himself !\nZagrues : \"Two can play at that game.........DARKNESS ! \"\n\nAnd thus, both Hades and Zagrues vanished from the view of the naked eye, off to the final and decisive showdown of Blood and Darkness..........such is the familly......of The Unseen Ones.\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nAt long last I am happy to present you all one of the most pumping OSTs from the Hades soundtrack !\nTo make it more convenient, this map includes two mods to spice up the things !\nIn standard mode, you will be playing from Zagrues POV !\nHelp him beat and survive his fathers endless blows so he might see his mother once more !\nOr.....if you wish to take a different approach.\nIn One Saber mode you will infuse you sword with the power of darkness and take on the POV of no less than Hades himself !\nShow your son you can still best him in combat !\n.........................................................................................................................................\nMany thanks to monster, steg universe, Kaltern and the BSMG for providing the much needed feedback which helped forge this map and help get it to where it is now ! :)\n\nHope you enjoy ! :)\n\nMap preview by Javierattor - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=namzq2MNvJ4\n","uploader":{"id":4285616,"name":"sp234","uniqueSet":true,"hash":"5f352ca7530c8e00061b14fe","avatar":"https://cdn.beatsaver.com/avatar/215418254980677643.png","type":"DISCORD"},"metadata":{"bpm":118.0,"duration":248,"songName":"Hades - The Unseen Ones","songSubName":"Game OST","songAuthorName":"Darren Korb","levelAuthorName":"Sp234"},"stats":{"plays":0,"downloads":6435,"upvotes":637,"downvotes":11,"score":0.9143},"uploaded":"2021-06-25T08:04:00.236Z","automapper":false,"ranked":false,"qualified":false,"versions":[{"hash":"d93d094ae17f25dedaee7796f7ca9fc078dc5060","key":"198ba","state":"Published","createdAt":"2021-06-25T08:04:00.236Z","sageScore":5,"diffs":[{"njs":10.0,"offset":0.6,"notes":554,"bombs":0,"obstacles":65,"nps":2.269,"length":480.25,"characteristic":"Standard","difficulty":"Normal","events":5589,"chroma":false,"me":false,"ne":false,"cinema":false,"seconds":244.195,"paritySummary":{"errors":4,"warns":0,"resets":0}},{"njs":13.0,"offset":-0.1,"notes":812,"bombs":4,"obstacles":135,"nps":3.325,"length":480.25,"characteristic":"Standard","difficulty":"Hard","events":5589,"chroma":false,"me":false,"ne":false,"cinema":false,"seconds":244.195,"paritySummary":{"errors":0,"warns":0,"resets":0}},{"njs":16.0,"offset":-0.55,"notes":1238,"bombs":0,"obstacles":160,"nps":5.069,"length":480.292,"characteristic":"Standard","difficulty":"Expert","events":5591,"chroma":false,"me":false,"ne":false,"cinema":false,"seconds":244.216,"paritySummary":{"errors":0,"warns":0,"resets":0}},{"njs":16.0,"offset":-0.55,"notes":878,"bombs":0,"obstacles":113,"nps":3.595,"length":480.333,"characteristic":"OneSaber","difficulty":"Expert","events":5589,"chroma":false,"me":false,"ne":false,"cinema":false,"seconds":244.237,"paritySummary":{"errors":0,"warns":0,"resets":0}}],"downloadURL":"https://cdn.beatsaver.com/d93d094ae17f25dedaee7796f7ca9fc078dc5060.zip","coverURL":"https://cdn.beatsaver.com/d93d094ae17f25dedaee7796f7ca9fc078dc5060.jpg","previewURL":"https://cdn.beatsaver.com/d93d094ae17f25dedaee7796f7ca9fc078dc5060.mp3"}],"createdAt":"2021-06-25T08:04:00.236Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-25T08:04:00.236Z","lastPublishedAt":"2021-06-25T08:04:00.236Z"},{"id":"9725","name":"Dua Lipa - Break My Heart","description":"Dua Lipa - Break My Heart\nThis is my second Dua Lipa map and it was super fun to make and test!
